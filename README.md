## Import in your project

I warmly suggest to use Gradle, Maven or a similar system to deal with dependencies within your project. In this case, you can use this product by importing the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.danilopianini</groupId>
    <artifactId>listset</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION_YOU_WANT_TO_USE</version>
</dependency>
```

or the following Gradle dependency:

```Gradle
compile 'org.danilopianini:listset:VERSION_YOU_WANT_TO_USE'
```

Alternatively, you can grab the latest jar and throw it in your classpath. In this case, be sure to include the dependencies of this project in your classpath as well.
